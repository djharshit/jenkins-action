# Simple Jenkins Pipeline

This repository provides a simple Jenkins pipeline script that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for your project. Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that allows you to define and execute pipelines as code, enabling efficient and consistent software delivery.

## Features

- Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying your project.
- Easy-to-understand Jenkinsfile with configurable stages.
- Supports different build and test tools.
- Customizable deployment options.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- A Jenkins server up and running.
- Required plugins installed on Jenkins (e.g., Git plugin, Pipeline plugin).
- Access to the project's source code repository.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or Jenkins server.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/djharshit/simple-jenkins-pipeline.git
   ```

2. Configure your Jenkins server with the necessary plugins and configurations.

3. Open the Jenkins web interface and create a new pipeline project.

4. Configure the pipeline to use the Jenkinsfile in the repository.

## Usage

The Jenkins pipeline consists of several stages that can be customized based on your project's requirements. The stages included in the provided Jenkinsfile are:

1. **Checkout**: Clones the project repository to the Jenkins workspace.

2. **Build**: Builds the project using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

3. **Test**: Runs the project's test suite.

4. **Deploy**: Deploys the built artifact to the target environment (e.g., staging, production).

5. **Notify**: Sends a notification or triggers downstream jobs upon successful deployment.

Feel free to modify the Jenkinsfile and add or remove stages to suit your project's needs. Additionally, you can configure environment-specific variables, define post-build actions, and integrate with external tools and services within each stage.

## Example

To run the pipeline for your project:

1. Configure the Jenkinsfile with your project-specific details and stages.

2. Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a webhook to trigger it automatically upon changes to your source code repository.

3. Monitor the pipeline execution in the Jenkins web interface.

4. View the pipeline's console output and logs for debugging or troubleshooting purposes.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of Jenkins, an open-source automation server. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the Jenkins community and the developers of Jenkins plugins. Thank you!
